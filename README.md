## Using KMeans for Uber trips

In this project, we use the power of KMeans clustering in real world use case. Imagine you are Uber and you would like to make recommandations to your drivers. These recommandations will tell the drivers the locations where they should be waiting to maximize their chances to have a pick-up call.

## Data

With this dataset : [uber-trip-data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response/tree/master/uber-trip-data)

1. Estimate the optimum number of clusters
2. Locate those clusters on a map
3. Separate the clusters according to time of day
4. What are the differences between KMeans and DBSCan ?
